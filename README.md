This is a little side project where I try to implement AI in different situation.
Concerning my others experiments with AI I may publish them at a later date because the folder is quite messy.
Don't expect any good quality code because chances are I won't optimize it unless I think it's too slow.
I would like to add that this is a combination of little project where I'm working alone so the comments may be sparse given that I may never read it again.
